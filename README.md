# **0x19. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO**
First bwe have to understand what is stack, queue, LIFO and FIFO. Also what is a data structure?

## **Data structure**
A data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data. It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently. A data structure is not only used for organizing the data. It is also used for processing, retrieving, and storing data.

## **1. stacks, queue,LIFO and FIFO**
### **1). Stack -> LIFO**
Stack is a linear data structure that follows FIFO rule (Last In First Out), meaning that the last element to be inserted is the first elment to be Deleted. In this case Insetion and Deletion is done at the top of stack.

### **2. Queue -> FIFO**
Queue is a lineer data structure that follows FIFO rule (First In First Out), here first element to be inserted in the queue will be deleted first, witn understandable explanation we can say insertion and deletion is dane at the bottomk of the stack
